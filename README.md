# AO.com Header Task

Your task is to create a reproduction of the AO.com header using HTML and CSS. I have created this starter project for you using Webpack Frontend Starterkit. You don't need to worry about the inner workings of this too much. You can do your work in the 'src' file. There is a basic SASS set up in there for the CSS which hopefully you will be able to work with. I've put a little bit in there to help you! If you need any help just give the members of the team a quick shout and they will be happy to help you.  Markup can just be completed in the 'index.html' file. The project has live reload so you will see you changes instantly.


### Installation

```
npm install
```

### Start Dev Server

```
npm start
```

### Build Prod Version

```
npm run build
```

### Features:

* ES6 Support via [babel](https://babeljs.io/) (v7)
* SASS Support via [sass-loader](https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader)
* Linting via [eslint-loader](https://github.com/MoOx/eslint-loader)

When you run `npm run build` we use the [mini-css-extract-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin) to move the css to a separate file. The css file gets included in the head of the `index.html`.
